# Fractal Trees
 
A tree generator utilizing fractal recursion, created in Unreal Engine 4 with C++. Dynamically generates a fractal based structure with user customizable parameters such as recursion depth, number of branches per iteration level, branch rotation randomness and branching probability. Branch height, radius, and  subsequent iteration dimension factoring can also be modified to create a diverse range of results, tailored to the users requirements.
